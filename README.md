# ML and Optimization Repository

Welcome to the "ML and Optimization" repository. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects centered around machine learning and optimization techniques, each grounded in foundational mathematical and computational principles. Ranging from facial recognition to advanced optimization methods, the content here offers both theoretical insights and practical applications, making it an invaluable resource for students, researchers, and professionals alike. Feel free to explore each of these techniques and applications.

## Contents:

- **Facial Recognition**: This project utilizes the eigenfaces method, a technique grounded in eigenvectors and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Faces are interpreted as high-dimensional data points, with major facial variations captured as "eigenfaces" derived from the facial data's covariance matrix, offering a concise representation to speed up recognition without compromising accuracy.

- **Gradient Methods**: Focusing on gradient-based optimization, this project explores techniques like Steepest Descent, Conjugate Gradient, BFGS, Newton's Method, and more. Emphasizing real-world applications in fields such as physics and machine learning, it also introduces advanced optimization strategies like the BFGS quasi-Newton method, making it a resourceful guide for diverse optimization challenges.

- **Markov Chains**: Leveraging the probabilistic constructs of Markov Chains, this text generator focuses on predicting word sequences based on transition probabilities. By creating a transition matrix from text data, the generator can simulate realistic language patterns, making it invaluable for applications like chatbot dialogues, random content generation, and literary inspiration.

- **Nearest Neighbor**: This project utilizes K-dimensional trees (KDTrees) and K-nearest neighbors in an algorithm for handwritten digit recognition. Underpinned by concepts such as Euclidean distance and KDTrees, the classifier showcases its capabilites by achieving a 93% accuracy rate on the MNIST dataset, emphasizing its applicability in domains like image recognition and geospatial data analysis.

- **OneD Optimization**: Focused on one-dimensional minimization, this project introduces classical algorithms such as the Golden Section Search and Newton's Method. Relying on mathematical derivatives and golden ratio principles, the project provides an array of methods for honing in on function minimizers, supported by dependencies like numpy and matplotlib for comprehensive evaluation and insights.
