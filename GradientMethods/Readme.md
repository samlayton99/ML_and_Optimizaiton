# Gradient Methods Project Description

In this project, there contains multiple files with optimization methods and techniques:

- 'gradient_methods.py' file contains the majority of the content.
- 'BFGS.py' file is a quasi-newton method for approximating the hessian.
- 'descent_practice.py' implements exact gradient descent
- 'quasi_newton.ipynb' includes practice problems and visualizations that explores other quasi-newton methods.

I highlight many different areas of optimization, focusing on various gradient-based methods. Methods such as the Steepest Descent, Conjugate Gradient, and Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient are central to the module. Additionally, I explore logistic regression—a cornerstone for classification in machine learning. 

## Mathematical Background and Overview of Functions

Gradient-based optimization stands at the crossroads of computational mathematics, providing tools to solve complex problems efficiently. Here is an overview of the mathematical concepts used:

1. **Steepest Descent**
    - Mathematically described, this method pursues a function's local minimum by taking steps consistent with the negative gradient at the current location.

2. **Conjugate Gradient**
    - An iterative strategy primarily to solve linear equations where the corresponding matrix is symmetric and positive-definite. It promises optimization with potential convergence in finite steps.

3. **Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient**
    - This method transforms the Conjugate Gradient approach to address nonlinear optimization challenges.

4. **Logistic Regression**
    - A statistical instrument aimed at predicting a binary outcome's likelihood. Predominantly used in machine learning for classification tasks.

5. **BFGS**
    - A member of the quasi-Newton family, the BFGS approach iteratively addresses unconstrained nonlinear optimization issues, updating the inverse Hessian matrix approximation.
