Other CS Paper Notes
Follows a fairly popular five section outline
Always 8-10 pages with everything that doesnâ€™t fit in the Appendix
Single and double columns are both common
Tables, charts, pseudo code algorithms are very common
Theorems, corollaries, and formulas are less common but still normal
